;;; Commentary:

;; This provides an extension to org-mode for syncing issues with JIRA
;; issue servers.

;;; News:

;;;; Changes in 4.3.1:
;; - Fix to make custom-jql results sync worklogs properly.

;;;; Changes in 4.3.0:
;; - Allow org-jira-set-issue-reporter call to dynamically set this value.

;;;; Changes in 4.1.0:
;; - Allow custom-jql to be specified and render in special files (see: README.md).

;;;; Changes in 4.0.0:
;; - Introduce SDK type for handling records vs random alist structures.

;;;; Changes since 3.1.0:
;; - Fix how we were ruining the kill-ring with kill calls.

;;;; Changes since 3.0.0:
;; - Add new org-jira-add-comment call (C-c c c)

;;;; Changes since 2.8.0:
;; - New version 3.0.0 deprecates old filing mechanism and files
;;   all of the changes under the top level ticket header.
;; - If you want other top level headers in the same file, this should
;;   work now, as long as they come after the main project one.

;;;; Changes since 2.7.0:
;; - Clean up multi-buffer handling, disable attachments call until
;; - refresh is compatible with it.

;;;; Changes since 2.6.3:
;; - Insert worklog import filter in the existing org-jira-update-worklogs-for-current-issue function
;; - Sync up org-clocks and worklogs!  Set org-jira-worklog-sync-p to nil to avoid.

;;;; Changes since 2.6.1:
;; - Fix bug with getting all issues when worklog is an error trigger.

;;;; Changes since 2.5.4:
;; - Added new org-jira-refresh-issues-in-buffer call and binding

;;;; Changes since 2.5.3:
;; - Re-introduce the commit that introduced a break into Emacs 25.1.1 list/array push
;;     The commit caused updates/comment updates to fail when a blank list of components
;;     was present - it will now handle both cases (full list, empty list).

;;;; Changes since 2.5.2:
;; - Revert a commit that introduced a break into Emacs 25.1.1 list/array push
;;     The commit caused updates/comment updates to fail

;;;; Changes since 2.5.1:
;; - Only set duedate if a DEADLINE is present in the tags and predicate is t

;;;; Changes since 2.5.0:
;; - Allow overriding the org property names with new defcustom

;;;; Changes since 2.4.0:
;; - Fix many deprecation/warning issues
;; - Fix error with allow-other-keys not being wrapped in cl-function

;;;; Changes since 2.3.0:
;; - Integration with org deadline and Jira due date fields

;;;; Changes since 2.2.0:
;; - Selecting issue type based on project key for creating issues

;;;; Changes since 2.1.0:
;; - Allow changing to unassigned user
;; - Add new shortcut for quick assignment

;;;; Changes since 2.0.0:
;; - Change statusCategory to status value
;; - Clean out some redundant code
;; - Add ELPA tags in keywords

;;;; Changes since 1.0.1:
;; - Converted many calls to async
;; - Removed minor annoyances (position resets etc.)
