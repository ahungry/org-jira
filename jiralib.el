;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides a programmatic interface to JIRA.  It provides access to
;; JIRA from other programs, but no user level functionality.

;; Jira References:

;; Primary reference (on current Jira, only REST is supported):
;; https://developer.atlassian.com/jiradev/jira-apis/jira-rest-apis

;; Full API list reference:
;; https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/cloud/

;; Legacy reference (unsupported and deprecated/unavailable):

;; JavaDoc for the Jira SOAP service

;;; News:

;;;; Changes since 2.6.3:
;; - Add worklog import filter and control variable for external worklogs.
;; - Add the worklog related endpoint/calls.

;;;; Changes since 2.1.0:
;; - Remove os_username / os_password manual http request as part of sign in process
;;     This produces sysadmin level warnings on Jira when these are used under the latest Jira.
;; - Remove unused function jiralib-link-issue
;; - Bring version up to match org-jira version so they can share tag

;;;; Changes since 2.0.0:
;; - Allow issue type query by project

;;;; Changes since 0.0.0:
;; - Converted many calls to async
;; - Converted many calls to make use of caching

This function should be used for all JIRA interface calls, as the
method ensures the user is logged in and invokes `soap-invoke'
with the correct service name and authentication token.

All JIRA interface methods take an authentication token as the
first argument.  The authentication token is supplied by this
function, so PARAMS should omit this parameter.  For example, the
\"getIssue\" method takes two parameters: auth and key, however,
when invoking it through `jiralib-call', the call should be:

  (jiralib-call \"getIssue\" KEY)

CALLBACK should be the post processing function to run with the
completed data from the request result, which can be accessed with:

  (cl-getf data :data)

as such, the CALLBACK should follow this type of form:

  (cl-function
    (lambda (&rest data &allow-other-keys)
      (print (cl-getf data :data))))

If CALLBACK is set to nil then the request will occur with sync.
This produces a noticeable slowdown and is not recommended by
request.el, so if at all possible, it should be avoided."

Variables:
  WORKLOG-OBJ is the passed in object

  UNWRAP-WORKLOG-RECORDS-FN is the function used to produce the list of worklog records from within the worklog-obj
  REWRAP-WORKLOG-RECORDS-FN is the function used to reshape the worklog records back into the form they were received in.

Auxiliary Notes:
  Only the WORKLOG-OBJ variable is required.
  The value of PPREDICATE-FN-LST is filled from the jiralib-worklog-import--filters-alist variable by default.
  If PREDICATE-FN-LST is empty the unmodified value of WORKLOG-OBJ is returned.
  If PREDICATE-FN-LST contains multiple predicate functions, each predicate filters operates as a clause in an AND match.  In effect, a worklog must match all predicates to be returned.
  The variable 'jiralib-user-login-name is used by many lambda filters."
